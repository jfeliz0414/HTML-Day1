Day#2: Implanting the syntax I learned during the first day while also playing around myself.
Day#3: Worked on getting use to HTML, and dabbed into CSS a little bit.
Day#4: Started CSS but it's definitly something I need to keep doing.
Day#5: CSS is a bit more tedious than I thought but I was able to implant some style to my Naruto Page.
Day#6: Finished my Naruto page. I'm ok with how it came out.
Day#7: Working on CSS more, and started a goal page but my net was down/no power most of the day but thats a side thing.
Day#8: Working on Page 2 from now. Going to implant a Nav bar, and I realized planning ahead is really the way to go.
